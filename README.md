# Archlinux-dots

Welcome to try out my configs that i use on Arch linux. 

My custom kernels are compiled on a intel nuc 13 1340 i5.
And are trimmed from modules with the help of modprobed-db
to get high responsiveness.

With graysky patch(raptorlake) https://github.com/graysky2/kernel_compiler_patch compile times.
real    4m50.813s
user    56m28.817s
sys     5m5.505s
